I've gotten a lot of design guidance in college, obviously, but I think the best bit of advice I've gotten wasn't necessarily from a professor or peer or from anyone at college.

Many people preach quality over quantity. In most cases, that's true. But not so in the case of practicing design. It's unfortunate that because quarters are so short, gauging a student's learning is hard to do except with projects. But projects bring pressure to put quality of quantity. So instead of designing something, failing, and learning, there's an emphasis on designing something the right way the first time. And that's not how progress is made.

I don't like thinking of it as "quality of quantity" or vice versa. But quantity brings quality. If you keep at it, you'll get good eventually.
