I can't believe I'm graduating. I've been in school for almost my whole life. It's part of who I am. College went by way faster than I thought it would. I never thought that my future would look anything like it does. Finding design has changed the way that I look at the world forever. I'm not sure where I will go from here, but I think I'm ready.
